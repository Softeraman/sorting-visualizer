## Sorting Visualizer üõ†Ô∏è

A web-based interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This tool allows you to visually understand how various sorting algorithms work in real-time. Perfect for beginners and anyone learning Data Structures & Algorithms.  

### Features
- Visualizes popular sorting algorithms:
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
  - **Heap Sort**
- Adjustable array size and speed
- Step-by-step visualization with color-coded comparisons
- Fully interactive and responsive UI

## Learnings üìö

While building this Sorting Visualizer, I gained hands-on experience with:  

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Deepened understanding of Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, and Heap Sort, including their time and space complexities.  
- **DOM Manipulation**: Learned to dynamically create, update, and animate array bars using JavaScript and CSS.  
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Practiced using `async/await` and `setTimeout` for smooth, step-by-step visualization.  
- **UI/UX Design**: Built an intuitive interface with interactive controls for speed and array size.  
- **Problem Solving**: Implemented algorithm logic visually, reinforcing algorithmic thinking and debugging skills.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the visualizer works seamlessly on different screen sizes.  

This project strengthened both my **algorithmic understanding** and **frontend development skills**, bridging theory with practical visualization.
